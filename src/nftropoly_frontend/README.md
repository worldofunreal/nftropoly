# NFTropoly Frontend

NFTropoly is a multichain, plug-and-play NFT marketplace that can be seamlessly integrated into any application, game, or platform. Built with Svelte and Internet Computer, it allows users to trade NFTs from ANY blockchain with zero gas fees and minimal configuration.

## Vision

NFTropoly aims to be the ultimate plug-and-play NFT marketplace - designed from the ground up to be embedded in any application, game, or dApp while maintaining a lightweight footprint. Whether you're developing a metaverse game, a social platform, or a blockchain application, NFTropoly provides immediate NFT trading capabilities with just a few lines of code.

## Business Model

- **3% Commission**: NFTropoly charges a small 3% commission on completed transactions (paid by the buyer), making the platform sustainable while keeping costs low for users.
- **No Gas Fees**: Transactions on NFTropoly are executed on the Internet Computer, eliminating gas fees typically associated with blockchain transactions.
- **Self-sustaining Ecosystem**: Commission fees support ongoing development, infrastructure, and feature enhancements.
- **Revenue Sharing**: For platforms that embed NFTropoly, revenue sharing options are available with custom splits of the commission fees.

## Key Features

- **Plug-and-Play Integration**: Add NFT marketplace functionality to any app with minimal code
- **Multichain Support**: Trade NFTs from Ethereum, Solana, Internet Computer, and more
- **No Gas Fees**: No gas fees for transactions - operations run on the Internet Computer
- **Multiple Payment Options**: 
  - Accept a wide variety of tokens as payment (cross-chain)
  - Fiat payment integration via Stripe (coming soon)
  - Additional fiat on/off-ramps planned
- **Flexible Trading Mechanisms**:
  - Standard listings
  - Auctions
  - Dutch auctions (declining price)
  - Atomic swaps (NFT for NFT)
  - Real-time swaps with tokens
- **Portable Deployment Options**: 
  - Component integration for React, Vue, Svelte apps
  - iFrame embedding for any website
  - JavaScript SDK for custom implementations
- **Internet Identity**: Secure authentication through Internet Computer's Identity service
- **Responsive Design**: Works on any device
