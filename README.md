# `nftropoly`

Welcome to your new `nftropoly` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

## NFTropoly - Multichain NFT Marketplace

NFTropoly is a modern NFT marketplace running on the Internet Computer blockchain. The platform features:

- **Responsive Design**: Distinct experiences optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **OpenSea-Inspired Desktop UI**: Clean, modern desktop interface with expandable sidebar
- **Dark/Light Themes**: User-selectable color themes with system preference detection
- **Internet Identity Integration**: Secure authentication using Internet Computer's identity system
- **Multi-chain Support**: Browse NFTs from multiple blockchains in one unified interface
- **Animated UI**: Smooth animations and transitions for an engaging user experience

### Responsive Design

The platform is built with a responsive design approach that creates optimized experiences for different device types:

- **Mobile Design** (< 640px): Streamlined interface with touch-optimized controls and a hamburger menu
- **Tablet Design** (640px-1024px): Hybrid approach with sidebar navigation and simplified layouts
- **Desktop Design** (> 1024px): Modern, clean interface inspired by OpenSea with a collapsible sidebar navigation

### Desktop Layout

The desktop experience features a modern, space-efficient layout:

- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Shows only icons by default, expands on hover to reveal labels
- **Minimal Header**: Clean header with centered search bar and wallet connection
- **Maximized Content Area**: Focused viewing experience with maximum screen real estate for content
- **Compact Footer**: Minimalist footer with key metrics and essential links

## Getting Started

To learn more before you start working with `nftropoly`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd nftropoly/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

## Frontend Development

For frontend development, use the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd src/nftropoly_frontend/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Testing Responsive Design

To test the responsive design during development:

1. Use your browser's developer tools to toggle device emulation
2. Preview the site on real mobile and tablet devices
3. Resize your browser window to see different breakpoints

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
